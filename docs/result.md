OBA generates two directories:

1. servers: it contains the OpenAPI specification and server implementation
2. queries: it contains all the queries.

## Query directory

The queries directory contains the queries files. These files are been generated by OBA.

There are three types of directories inside the queries directory: 

1. Default queries (_default_): contains the default queries generated by OBA. 
2. Custom queries (_custom_): Sometimes the OBA user needs more flexible, the custom directory contains these special queries.
3. By classes: OBA creates a query directory per class. It allows to OBA user to modify the default queries for the class. 

!!!info
    The server uses the query from the default directory. Unless, the query exists in the class directory.
                       

### Default queries

OBA generated the following queries:

- get_all: Get all the resources of a type `GET /persons` in the DataStore.
- get_all_user: Get all the resources of a type `GET /persons?username=USER` in the graph **USER**.
- get_one: Get the resource ID `GET /persons/ID` in the DataStore.
- get_one_user: Get the resource with the `GET /persons/ID?username=USER` in the graph **USER**.

The queries for POST, PUT and DELETE cannot be modified.

## Server directory

The servers directory contains:

- [File] OpenAPI specification `openapi.yaml` 
- [Directory] Server implementation (default: python)
