We have tested out OBA with different example ontologies to ensure its fucntionality. Check the [examples](https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/OBA/tree/master/examples) directory on GitHub for sample configurations to test the system. We describe some of them briefly below:

1. The [DBPedia configuration](https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/OBA/tree/master/examples/dbpedia) shows how to use OBA to filter an on ontology of significant size to include just a few classes and properties of interest.
2. The [P-Plan ontology configuration](https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/OBA/tree/master/examples/pplan) shows how to load an ontology using its URI. OBA will do the content negotiation.
3. The [WINGS configuration](https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/OBA/tree/master/examples/wings) shows how to load an ontology network in OBA.
4. The [Model Catalog configuration](https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/OBA/tree/master/examples/modelcatalog) illustrates how to add custom queries in OBA, as well as to include full support for POST, PUT and DELETE methods in the specification.
